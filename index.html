<h3>ACT 1</h3>
<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
Two Households,both alike in dignity,
<br>
In fair Verona,where we lay our scene,
<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
<br>
Where civil blood makes civil nands unclean.
<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
<br>
A pair of star-cross`d lovers take their life;
<br>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
<br>
Do with their death bury their parents` strife.
<br>
The Fearful passage of their death-mark`d love,
<br>
And the continuance of their parents`rage,
<br>
Which,but their children`s end,nought could remove,
<br>
Is now the two hours` traffic of our stage;
<br>
The which if you with patient ears attend,
<br>
What here shall miss,our toil shall strive to mend.
<br>
<h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>
<br><i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY,of the house of Capulet,armed and bucklers</i>
<br>
<h3>SAMPSON</h3>
<br>
Gregory,o`my word,well not carry coals.
<br>
<h3>GREGORY</h3>
<br>
No,for then we should be colliers.
